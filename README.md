# Control Systems Projects - Process Control and Optimization

This repository includes two advanced projects in process control. These projects cover various control methods, dynamic system modeling, and simulation using MATLAB and Simulink.

## Project 1: Dynamic System with State Feedback and Observer Design

### Objective
To analyze and control a dynamic system characterized by a continuous transfer function, using state-space representation, state feedback control, and full-order observer design.

### Tasks
1. **State-Space Representation**:
   - Converted the systemâ€™s transfer function to state-space form.
   - Verified back-conversion from state-space to transfer function to ensure consistency.

2. **State Feedback Control**:
   - Implemented state feedback control using Simulink.
   - Simulated system response for various closed-loop pole configurations (slow, medium, fast) and identified optimal pole placements.

3. **Full-Order Observer Design**:
   - Designed and simulated a full-order observer with various observer poles.
   - Compared real and estimated states with both zero and non-zero initial conditions.

4. **Controller Testing**:
   - Simulated controller performance with and without direct state measurement, using state estimates from the observer.

5. **Advanced Controller with Integral Action** (Bonus):
   - Designed an extended state feedback controller with integral action.
   - Evaluated performance for both slow and fast closed-loop poles.

### Tools
- MATLAB for calculations and Simulink for system modeling and simulations.

## Project 2: PID, DMC, and GPC Controllers for Discrete Systems

### Objective
To design, implement, and compare various control algorithms, including PID, Dynamic Matrix Control (DMC), and Generalized Predictive Control (GPC), for a discrete system represented by a transfer function.

### Tasks
1. **Discrete Transfer Function and Difference Equation**:
   - Derived the discrete transfer function and its corresponding difference equation.
   
2. **PID Controller**:
   - Implemented a PID controller using the Ziegler-Nichols tuning method.
   - Simulated continuous and digital PID responses, noting effects on system output and control signal.

3. **DMC Algorithm**:
   - Designed a DMC controller in MATLAB, adjusting prediction and control horizons for optimal response.
   - Analyzed DMC performance based on control quality, setpoint tracking, and stability under parameter variations.

4. **GPC Algorithm**:
   - Implemented a GPC controller and compared its performance to DMC, focusing on handling disturbances and prediction capabilities.
   - Conducted stability region analysis for the DMC and GPC controllers under gain variations.

5. **Comparison of DMC and GPC**:
   - Compared the stability, responsiveness, and disturbance rejection of the DMC and GPC algorithms, highlighting the strengths of each approach for different control scenarios.

### Tools
- MATLAB for all simulations and code implementations.
